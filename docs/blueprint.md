- Use a set of clear, concise outline-style icons that are easily recognizable and reinforce financial concepts like savings, spending, accounts, and reports.
- Employ a clean, structured layout with ample whitespace to enhance readability and ensure an organized, intuitive display of financial information, especially for dashboards and reports.
- Incorporate subtle and purposeful animations for state changes, data filtering, and transitions between sections, providing smooth feedback and improving the user's perception of responsiveness.
